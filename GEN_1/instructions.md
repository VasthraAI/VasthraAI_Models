# Intructions

- This document contains in detail instructions the following:
1. Using preprocessing scripts
2. Preparing the dataset
3. Creating sketches for dataset (optional)
4. Training the GAN model
5. Generating images

# Using preprocessing scripts
 * In order to ease the implementation process, a few scripts have been provided. Here is how to use them properly.

## resize_color.py

- This is a Python script that processes images by resizing them to 512x512 pixels and converting them to RGB format.
- This is necessary since the GAN can only use square images and

### Training Process

- The two networks are trained in opposition:

**Generator Goal**: To "fool" the discriminator by producing data that looks as real as possible.

**Discriminator Goal**: To correctly distinguish real data from fake data.
The process can be broken down into steps:

**Step 1**: The generator creates fake data from random noise.
**Step 2**: The discriminator is fed both real data (from the dataset) and fake data (from the generator) and tries to classify them.
**Step 3**: The discriminator provides feedback:
If it correctly identifies real vs. fake, it improves its ability to detect.
If it’s fooled by the generator, the generator learns how to improve its output.
**Step 4**: Both networks update their parameters through backpropagation, and the cycle repeats.

### The Adversarial Dynamic

This setup creates a "game" between the generator and discriminator:

- The generator gets better at creating realistic data.
- The discriminator gets better at spotting fakes.
- Over time, they reach an equilibrium where the generator produces highly realistic outputs.

## Applications

GANs are widely used for:

- Generating realistic images (e.g., faces, artwork).
- Image-to-image translation (e.g., turning sketches into photos).
- Data augmentation (creating synthetic data for training).

## Challenges

- **Training Instability**: Balancing the generator and discriminator can be tricky.
- **Mode Collapse**: The generator might produce limited varieties of outputs.

In essence, GANs are like an artist (generator) and a critic (discriminator) working together—or against each other—to create something new and convincing!
